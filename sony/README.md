# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

# Sample AEM project template

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* [core:](core/README.md) Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* [it.tests:](it.tests/README.md) Java based integration tests
* [ui.apps:](ui.apps/README.md) contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, and templates
* [ui.content:](ui.content/README.md) contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps
* ui.config: contains runmode specific OSGi configs for the project
* [ui.frontend:](ui.frontend.general/README.md) an optional dedicated front-end build mechanism (Angular, React or general Webpack project)
* [ui.tests:](ui.tests/README.md) Cypress based UI tests (for other frameworks check [aem-test-samples](https://github.com/adobe/aem-test-samples) repository
* all: a single content package that embeds all of the compiled modules (bundles and content packages) including any vendor dependencies
* analyse: this module runs analysis on the project which provides additional validation for deploying into AEMaaCS

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

## Documentation

The build process also generates documentation in the form of README.md files in each module directory for easy reference. Depending on the options you select at build time, the content may be customized to your project.

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

### Unit tests

This show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To
test, execute:

    mvn clean test

### Integration tests

This allows running integration tests that exercise the capabilities of AEM via
HTTP calls to its API. To run the integration tests, run:

    mvn clean verify -Plocal

Test classes must be saved in the `src/main/java` directory (or any of its
subdirectories), and must be contained in files matching the pattern `*IT.java`.

The configuration provides sensible defaults for a typical local installation of
AEM. If you want to point the integration tests to different AEM author and
publish instances, you can use the following system properties via Maven's `-D`
flag.

| Property              | Description                                         | Default value           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `it.author.url`       | URL of the author instance                          | `http://localhost:4502` |
| `it.author.user`      | Admin user for the author instance                  | `admin`                 |
| `it.author.password`  | Password of the admin user for the author instance  | `admin`                 |
| `it.publish.url`      | URL of the publish instance                         | `http://localhost:4503` |
| `it.publish.user`     | Admin user for the publish instance                 | `admin`                 |
| `it.publish.password` | Password of the admin user for the publish instance | `admin`                 |

The integration tests in this archetype use the [AEM Testing
Clients](https://github.com/adobe/aem-testing-clients) and showcase some
recommended [best
practices](https://github.com/adobe/aem-testing-clients/wiki/Best-practices) to
be put in use when writing integration tests for AEM.

## Static Analysis

The `analyse` module performs static analysis on the project for deploying into AEMaaCS. It is automatically
run when executing

    mvn clean install

from the project root directory. Additional information about this analysis and how to further configure it
can be found here https://github.com/adobe/aemanalyser-maven-plugin

### UI tests

They will test the UI layer of your AEM application using Cypress framework.

Check README file in `ui.tests` module for more details.

Examples of UI tests in different frameworks can be found here: https://github.com/adobe/aem-test-samples

## ClientLibs

The frontend module is made available using an [AEM ClientLib](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/clientlibs.html). When executing the NPM build script, the app is built and the [`aem-clientlib-generator`](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) package takes the resulting build output and transforms it into such a ClientLib.

A ClientLib will consist of the following files and directories:

- `css/`: CSS files which can be requested in the HTML
- `css.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `css/` so they can be merged)
- `js/`: JavaScript files which can be requested in the HTML
- `js.txt` (tells AEM the order and names of files in `js/` so they can be merged
- `resources/`: Source maps, non-entrypoint code chunks (resulting from code splitting), static assets (e.g. icons), etc.

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:
